Fantasy Football Stat Tracking 2015-2016

<p> FFStats.xlsx : Excel Spreadsheet to add data in (has some smart cells to calculate totals and stuff - could be done away with)</p>

<p>FFStats.csv : .csv file of the same spreadsheet, I use to import the data into R.</p>

<p>FF_data_analysis.R : A set of commands that generates a bunch of back-of-the-envelope interesting data.</p>
